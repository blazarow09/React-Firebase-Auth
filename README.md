# React Firebase Auth

This is a simple app skeleton.

Created using:<br>
  -React<br>
  -Typescript<br>
  -Firebase<br>
  -MobX<br>
  -Material UI<br>

You can use it for your purposes.

Here you go some screenshots of how it looks:

Yes, it looks very simple, but the main goal of this is to use the authentication logic and extend it for your needs.

The `AppTabs.ts` component is where private data is stored. There you can add your components and separate them with a router switch.

Edit the `firebase-config.ts` file with your credentials in order to grant access to the firebase.

Run `npm install`, then `npm run start` and code the world.
